# Quick Start: Enable PWA Installation

## 🚀 Quick Setup (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Generate Icons
Choose ONE of these methods:

#### Method A: Browser Generator (Easiest - No Install Required)
1. Open `public/generate-icons.html` in your browser
2. Click both download buttons
3. Save the icons in the `public` folder
4. Done! ✅

#### Method B: Use Node Script (If you have sharp installed)
```bash
npm install --save-dev sharp
node scripts/generate-pwa-icons.js
```

#### Method C: Convert SVG Manually
Use any SVG to PNG converter:
- Open `public/icon.svg` 
- Convert to PNG at 192x192 and 512x512
- Save as `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png` in `public/`

### Step 2: Test It!
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open in Chrome/Edge on mobile or desktop:
- **Mobile**: You'll see an install prompt after 3 seconds
