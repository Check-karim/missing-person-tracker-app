## Notification System Status

### ‚úÖ Notifications ARE Working

Notifications are triggered when:

1. **Status Update** ‚Üí Notifies reporter when someone else changes status
   - Example: Admin marks case as "found"
   - Notification: "Great news! John Doe has been found."

2. **Comments** ‚Üí Notifies reporter when someone else comments
   - Example: User adds tip to a case
   - Notification: "Someone commented on the case: John Doe"

3. **Case Updates** ‚Üí Notifies reporter when someone else updates details ‚≠ê **NEWLY ADDED**
   - Example: Admin updates priority or description
   - Notification: "Your report for John Doe has been updated."

### How to Verify Notifications:

1. Create a case as User A
2. Login as User B (or admin)
3. Update the case, change status, or add comment
4. Check User A's notifications ‚Üí Should see the update

## Changes Made

### 1. ‚úÖ Fixed Missing Notification on Updates
- **File:** `src/app/api/missing-persons/[id]/route.ts`
- **Issue:** General updates didn't trigger notifications
- **Fix:** Added notification creation when case is updated by someone other than reporter
- **Impact:** Now all update types consistently trigger notifications

### 2. ‚úÖ Fixed TypeScript Middleware Issues
- **File:** `src/lib/middleware.ts`
- **Issue:** Middleware didn't support route handlers with params
- **Fix:** Made middleware generic to accept additional arguments
- **Impact:** Eliminated TypeScript errors and improved type safety

## Testing

### Automated Test Script Created ‚úÖ
**File:** `test-api.js`

**Run with:**
```bash
npm run dev    # In one terminal
node test-api.js    # In another terminal
```

**Tests 30+ scenarios including:**
- All CRUD operations
- Notification triggers
- Admin features
- Validation & error handling
- Security & permissions

### Documentation Created ‚úÖ
1. **API_AUDIT_REPORT.md** - Complete API documentation (15+ pages)
2. **TEST_GUIDE.md** - Step-by-step testing instructions
3. **API_STATUS_SUMMARY.md** - This file (quick overview)
