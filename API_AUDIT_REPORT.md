## Notification System Analysis

### Notification Triggers

| Action | Trigger Condition | Notification Type | Recipient |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Status Update | Someone other than reporter updates status | `status_update` or `found` | Original reporter |
| Case Update | Someone other than reporter updates case details | `general` | Original reporter |
| Comment Added | Someone other than reporter comments | `comment` | Original reporter |

### Notification Prevention Logic
- ✅ Self-notifications are prevented (user won't receive notification for their own actions)
- ✅ Reporter ID check ensures only relevant parties are notified
- ✅ Notification created AFTER successful database update

### Database Schema for Notifications

```sql
CREATE TABLE notifications (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,                           -- Recipient
    missing_person_id INT,                          -- Related case
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,                    -- Notification title
    message TEXT NOT NULL,                          -- Notification message
    type ENUM('status_update', 'comment', 'found', 'general'),
    is_read BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (missing_person_id) REFERENCES missing_persons(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Missing Person Update Endpoint ✅

**File:** `src/app/api/missing-persons/[id]/route.ts`

**Issue:** General updates to missing person details did not trigger notifications, creating inconsistency with status updates and comments.

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// Added after the update query
if (existing[0].reporter_id !== req.user!.id) {
  await query(
    `INSERT INTO notifications (user_id, missing_person_id, title, message, type)
     VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)`,
    [
      existing[0].reporter_id,
      params.id,
      'Case Updated',
      `Your report for ${existing[0].full_name} has been updated.`,
      'general'
    ]
  );
}
```

**Result:** Now reporters receive notifications when:
- Admins update their case details
- Other users with permission update case information
- Any fields are modified (priority, physical description, contact info, etc.)

### 2. Fixed Middleware TypeScript Issues ✅

**File:** `src/lib/middleware.ts`

**Issue:** Middleware function signatures didn't support route handlers with additional parameters (like `{ params }`), causing TypeScript errors.

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// Changed from:
export function authMiddleware(handler: (req: AuthRequest) => Promise<NextResponse>)

// To:
export function authMiddleware<T extends any[]>(
  handler: (req: AuthRequest, ...args: T) => Promise<NextResponse>
)
```

**Result:** Middleware now properly supports Next.js route handlers with dynamic parameters.
